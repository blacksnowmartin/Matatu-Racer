# Matatu Racer Game Guide

### 1. **Game Setup**
   - **Platform:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - **Canvas:** Use the `<canvas>` element for drawing the matatu, road, obstacles, and other elements.
   - **Controls:** Arrow keys or swipe gestures for left, right, up, and down.

### 2. **Game Elements**
   - **Matatu Sprite:** Draw or use a simple matatu icon to represent the player's vehicle.
   - **Road & Background:** Draw lanes and add Kenyan-themed obstacles like potholes, pedestrians, and maybe even "Kanjo" (city council officers).
   - **Obstacles:** Randomly generate objects on the road that players must avoid to stay in the game. These could include:
     - Potholes
     - Vendors and pedestrians
     - Traffic barriers
     - "Kanjo" (city council officers)

### 3. **Game Mechanics**
   - **Movement:** Allow players to move left and right to avoid obstacles.
   - **Point System:** Players earn points for every second they avoid an obstacle and get extra points for collecting passengers or tokens that appear on the road.
   - **Collision Detection:** If the matatu hits an obstacle, end the game and display the score.
   - **Speed Increase:** As time progresses, gradually increase the speed of obstacles to make the game more challenging.

### 4. **Game Features**
   - Simple and intuitive controls using arrow keys
   - Randomly generated obstacles
   - Progressive difficulty
   - Score tracking
   - Collision detection system
   - Visual feedback for game events

### 5. **Additional Enhancements**

   - **Score Display:** Show the current score on the screen as the player progresses.
   - **Game Restart:** After game over, allow players to restart the game to beat their previous score.
